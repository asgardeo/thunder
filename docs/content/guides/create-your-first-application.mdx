    [https://localhost:8090/develop](https://localhost:8090/develop)

2.  Enter your credentials (`admin` / `admin`) and click **Sign In**.

    :::note
    If you see a security warning about a self-signed certificate, you can safely proceed by clicking **Advanced** -> **Proceed**.

## 2. Navigate to Applications

Once you are logged in, you will land on the developer dashboard.

### Step 4: Select Technology

Choose the technology stack for your application to get tailored integration instructions.

*   **Mobile Application**: For iOS or Android apps.
*   **Backend Service**: For M2M communication.

**Example**: Select **React** if you are building a React application.

Click **Create** or **Finish**.

## 4. Get Your Credentials

After the application is created, you will be redirected to the **Quick Start** or **Overview** tab of your new application.

Note down the following important details:
*   **Client ID**: A unique identifier for your application.
*   **Client Secret** (if applicable): A secret key for secure authentication (usually for Web Apps and Backend Services).
